* Use [FastGaussianQuadrature](https://github.com/JuliaApproximation/FastGaussQuadrature.jl) instead of QuadGK to make the BGK:
* Consider better integration methods to get the charge density

* should box be a part of each specie?
* All functions requiring box and specie should ensure they  have the same dimensions
