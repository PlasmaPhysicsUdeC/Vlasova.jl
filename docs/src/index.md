# Vlasova

> A package to solve the Vlasov-Poisson system of equations numerically, under development by Jorge Gidi for the Group of Plasma Physics of the University of Concepci√≥n, Chile.

## Introduction

Vlasova is a package *mostly* written in julia, which aims to provide a set of tools to perform and examine Vlasov-Poisson simulations easily.

## Features

The Vlasova package provides tools to easily:
* Define and evolve plasmas, which can be
  * 1 or 2-dimensional
  * Multi-specie

* Examine the results of a simulation generically
* Implement *non-gradient* integrators
* Perform multi-threaded simulations

## Asumptions

* The plasmas are electrostatic.

Vlasova considers the Vlasov equation coupled to the Poisson equation. This means that the plasmas are always assumed to behave electrostatically, since the electric field is obtained self-consistently from the electrostatic potential held by plasma *distribution function*.

* The phase space is periodic in positions and velocities

Vlasova utilizes Fourier Transforms in the space as well as velocity dimensions, which require periodicity along them.


## TODO: Redo documentation.

Latex strings are enclosed by double backticks, `.

For example
```markdown
`` 
\frac{1}{2}
	``
```
will produce

`` 
\frac{1}{2}
``

Note that the  backslash, `\`, does not need to be escaped. This is not true for documentation in `.jl` files, where it should be replaced by
```markdown
`` 
\\frac{1}{2}
``
```

Also, you can use environments such as `math`, `jldoctest` and `@example`, but only in markdown files, NOT in the `.jl` files.

Some examples of this environments are shown below:

* This is math environment:
```math
Ax^2 + Bx + C = 0
```

* This is a doctest
```jldoctest
a = 1
b = 2
a + b

# output
3
```

* And this is an example. Note that the result is calculated and automatically appended.
```@example
a = ones(10)
```
